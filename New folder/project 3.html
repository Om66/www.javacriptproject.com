	<h2>Introduction of java scripts</h2>
</font>
<p>The first ever JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape, and has since been updated to conform to ECMA-262 Edition 5 and later versions. This engine, code named SpiderMonkey, is implemented in C/C++.</p>
<h3>what is java script?
</h3>
<p>The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
	<br>
Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
<br>
In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">java</a>.</p>

<tr>
	<td>When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.<br>

But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript">ECMAScript</a>, and now it has no relation to Java at all.</td>

<h3>what can in-broswer javascrit do?</h3>
<p>Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.<br>

JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc.<br>

In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.</p></font>
