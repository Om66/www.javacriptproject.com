	<h1>3 Websites to Learn JavaScript Coding for FREE </h1>
</marquee>
	<h2>1. Introduction to JavaScript @ Codecademy</h2>
	<p>In one word, this is one of the best free JavaScript tutorials, and I have learned JavaScript from this website. It is also one of the best platforms to learn new technologies online but probably the best website to learn JavaScript online.<br>
		Even though currently, Codecademy offers Java, Git, UNIX command line, and several other courses, it made its name by an interactive JavaScript course to learn online at your own pace.<br>
	</p>

	<h3>2. Free JavaScript Tutorials @ Udemy</h3>\
	
	<p>This is one of the best places for online learning. You will get free online courses and tutorials in all the latest technology and programming language like Java, Spring, Data Structure and Algorithms, Selenium, REST, etc. It provides both free and paid resources.</p>

	<h4>3. JavaScript Guide @ freecodecamp.org</h4>
	<p>This is one of the most awesome community websites which will help you to learn to code for free, build real-world projects, and get a job as a developer.<br>
It has a massive collection of interactive tutorials and exercises to learn JavaScript, Data Structure and Algorithms, Frontend Development, and so on.<br>
